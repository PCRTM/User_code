1.	DEFINITIONS

A.	“Contributor” means Government Agency, as the developer of the Original Software, and any entity that makes a Modification.
B.	“Covered Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Modification alone or when combined with the Subject Software.

$InputPar
	sensor_id  = 26

* absorption coefficient datasets associated with senor id 26-37 are obtained using lblrtm v-12.2. Those datasets can be used for the RT calculation in the atmosphere with the simulation for the absorption of 15 trace gases being included.  Solar radiation contribution simulation function for those sensor ids is provided.


** To switch from one sensor to another, simple change the sensor_id number in 'pcrtm.in'. For airborne instrument like NAST-I and SHIS, forward simulation for unrealistic situation (e.g. observation height above 100 hPc) will not result in warning message, but the results are not reliable. You might want to consider setting the  “Geometry%pobs” to be realistic aircraft pressure level in the example pcrtm driver code "FWD_simu_sample.f90”.  
** molindx can be set to 0, 1, or 2 for each of the 15 trace gases (H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, OO2 ,NO1, SO2,NO2, NH3,NO3,Cl4,F11,F12). when molindx =0, the corresponding trace gas absorption (emission) will be treated as fixed gas and the US standard atmosphere will be used as the default profile. When molindx =1, the corresponding trace gas absorption (emission) will be treated as a variable gas and the US standard atmosphere will be used as the default profile. When molindx =2, the corresponding trace gas absorption (emission) will be treated as a variable gas and the user has to provide an atmospheric profile.
** scalfac is a scaling factor used to scale the standard or user provided atmospheric profiles
** jacob is a logical variable used to determine if jacobian will be calculated or not
chdomain is a logical variable used to determine if the channel radiances will be calculated or not.
** jacob_ch is a logical variable used to determine if channel jacobian will be calculated or not.
** BT_FLAG  is a logical variable used to determine if brightness temperature will be calculated or not.
** JACOB_BT is a logical variable used to determine if Jacobian associated with brightness temperature will be calculated or not (both Jacob and jacob_ch need to be set as 'true' ).
** TR_FLAG is a logical variable used to determine if transmittance in channel domain will be calculated or not.
** Users need to provide surface emissivity specified in the mono frequency domain by assigning and modifying the “RT_solution” structure:
     RT_solution%emis = ..............................
where dimension of the mono frequency domain is specified by the “PCRTM_stnd” structure of each sensor. The mono frequency bins are specified by  “PCRTM_stnd%frq”.

Output in either Principal Component (PC) domain or channel domains are included in the “EOF_solution” structure.  Calculated Jacobians are included in the “K_ch” (in channel domain) and “K_pc” (in PC domain) structures.
